This project focuses on the development of a web application for a residential association management, the syetem is a full-stack application
The database had the next tables: Users, Residents, Water_Meters, Maintenance Table, Announcements, Read_Announcements, Payments, Requests, Building_Settings. Each table is connected through logical relationships
The application provides two main roles, the residents/tenants and the administrator, each one being able to do the necessary actions for a logical and a correct running of the administration.
The residents can declare the water meters, which are saved in the database, afterwards being used to calculate the maintenance table, alongside other things. Other things the tenants can do is see the month's maintenance table, but also the old ones. They can also see Announcements from the building administrator, they can write requests towards the administrator and also they can see the organizational chart of the administration and the schedule of it. Another thing the users that have the resident role can do is paying the amount they owe in the respective month, with the help of the Stripe Technologies.
The administrator can press a button to calculate the month's maintenance table, check payments, write announcements, read requests and register cash payments.
